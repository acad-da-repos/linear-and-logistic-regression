# Linear and Logistic Regression Assignment

## Problem Description

In this assignment, you will implement simple linear and logistic regression models using scikit-learn. These are foundational machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `assignment.py` file.
2.  You will find two function definitions: `train_linear_regression(X, y)` and `train_logistic_regression(X, y)`.
3.  Your task is to implement these functions:
    *   `train_linear_regression`: Train a `LinearRegression` model on the input features `X` and target `y`.
    *   `train_logistic_regression`: Train a `LogisticRegression` model on the input features `X` and target `y`.
4.  Both functions should return the trained model.

## Further Exploration (Optional)

*   How can you evaluate the performance of these models (e.g., R-squared for linear regression, accuracy/precision/recall for logistic regression)?
*   Explore other regression and classification algorithms in scikit-learn.
*   How can you handle categorical features in these models?
